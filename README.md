## Info
An explanation of this tool:

Google Chrome always store user data in the same place, so the stealer generated by Mercurial Grabber has no problem in finding it. In theory at least, this data is stored in encrypted form. However, if the malware has already penetrated the system, then its actions are done in your name.

Therefore, the malware simply finds a way to decrypt information stored on your computer (by making it seem like thie user is requesting it) . The stealer gets all your passwords and cookies. 

The tool is also able to find Roblox cookies that are stored in the Windows Registry. By running the malicious .exe file, it is able to search for the Roblox cookie. The same goes for Minecraft sessions, Discord tokens, etc since it is stored in the user's computer.
